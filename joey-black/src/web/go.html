<h1>Go</h1>

<p>
	Go is an ancient Chinese board game. The skill required to play is comparable to the skill 
	required to play Chess. For computers however, the challenge of Go is much greater than that 
	of Chess. In this project I am exploring various algorithms and data structures that are used
	for computer Go. I have also begun implementing these algorithms in a few different languages.
</p>

<h3>Implementations</h3>

<ol>
<li>Java - My initial Java implementation is described in the paper below. 
 It uses Monte Carlo UCT and bitboards.</li><br />
<li>C++ - For a variety of reasons, I decided to rewrite my Java Go engine in C++.
 I believe this may prove to have some advantages in the area the bitboard operations.
 More detailed results should be forthcoming.</li><br />
<li>Lisp - Ah Lisp, how I have come to love you. I was looking for a good starter project
 to help me learn Lisp and a Go engine seemed to be an obvious choice. The main difference
 between this implementation and the previous two is the use of the disjoint-set data
 structure in place of the bitboard. I felt that this would be a more appropriate model
 for Lisp. Initial tests indicate that this implementation is about 20% slower than
 the one in C++.</li>
