<h1>Graphics</h1>

<p>The following projects were developed for a graphics class at UNF. 
 They were created using C++ and OpenGL.</p>

<br />

<h3>Ray Tracing</h3>

<p>
The banner at the top of this page is a rendering of spheres using ray tracing
 along with light, shadowing, reflection and refraction techniques.

<h3>3D Animation Engine</h3>
<p>
This project adds animation to 3D wire frames. The image below is of a
 dragon head being rotated about the y axis.

<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>
This project uses the painter's algorithm to add lighting to 3D models.
 The image below shows a sphere with light shining on it from the upper right.
