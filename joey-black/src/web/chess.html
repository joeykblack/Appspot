<h1>Chess</h1>

<p>
	For my first AI project, I decided 
	to tackle the classic challenge of teaching the computer to play chess. I have 
	started off simple. My AI uses a simple minimax implementation that is only 
	capable of looking a few moves ahead. For the data structure, I used bitboards. 
	These simple structures are a really efficient and compact way of representing 
	the board.
