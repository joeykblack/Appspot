<h1>Particle Systems</h1>

<p>This project is intended to explore the rendering of a particle system. 
 It was develop during an independent study course at UNF with Dr. Chua.
 The code was developed in C++ with OpenGL. NVIDIA specific hardware acceleration
 was used. </p>

<p>
<a href="/pdf/PStutorial.pdf">Tutorial</a> - 
The purpose of this tutorial is to explain the methods I used to design and implement my
particle system. My particle system is not intended to actuarially simulate a system of particles, but
instead to give a simulation that looks good. To implement my system, I used C++ with OpenGL and
GLUT. Many of the functions I use require hardware acceleration that is currently specific to NVIDIA
graphics cards.
